# Fuzzy-Inference-System

In this project, we are going to look at a fuzzy system that determines how much you should tip in a restuarant given tow inputs:
- **Food Quality**
- **Service Qulity**

As any other fuzzy inference system, we are going to break this problem up to 3 distinct sections:

1. ***Fuzzification***
2. ***Inference***
3. ***Defuzzification***

> _More information and documantation is available in the project notebook_
